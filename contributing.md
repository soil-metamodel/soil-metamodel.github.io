## Ways to Contribute

1. Add Data (See the [Data](https://soil-metamodel.github.com/data.html) page.)
2. Lead a new analysis
 * create a new issue in github
 * create a new repository for the analysis
3. Lead a proposal to follow up on ideas from the workshop
 * create a new issue in github

## Using Github

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. edit anything you want by clicking the edit / pencil icon
3. fork and clone the repository
4. ask questions, suggest changes, manuscripts, proposals as a new [github 'issue'](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/soil-metamodel.github.com/issues/new).

### Within Github

It is pretty easy to make edits directly (e.g. try attempting to edit one of the files here (e.g. [Introduction.md]( https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/edit/master/Introduction.md#fullscreen_blob_contents) after you have an account). It should walk you through the steps of suggesting an edit via pull request.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository)
